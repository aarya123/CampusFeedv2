{"title":"Purdue Student Pugwash Midwest Regional Conference 2014","categories":"[Conference]","desc":"Conference Biography Purdue Student Pugwash proudly presents the ninth annual Midwest Regional Conference held on April 4-5, 2014. This year&rsquo;s conference is titled Epidemic Success, Injecting our Future. The conference will focus on the social and ethical dimensions relating to current issues that ultimately allude to Medical Diseases. Conference topics will include Environmental Public Health, Food and Waterborne Disease, BioDefense, Public Policy on Smoking and Tobacco, Epidemic Scare, Disease Reporting, Health-Care Associated Infections, Rare Diseases, Populace as a Medium, and more. These topics will be presented by experts in their respective fields. Dr. Andrew Hyland, Chair Department of Health Behavior Division of Cancer Prevention  Population Sciences at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Director of New York State Smokers' Quitline, will be featured in Public Policy on Smoking and Tobacco. Dr. Daniel Morgan, Assistant Professor of University of Maryland School of Medicine and founding member of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America Research Network, will be featured in Health-Care Associated Infections. Dr. David Sanders, Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at Purdue University, will be featured in BioDefense. We are working to bring these important issues of emerging and re-emerging diseases not only to the students, professors, and faculty of Purdue, but also to the surrounding community. Due to the varying backgrounds of our attendees, we strive to have the conference presented in a manner that is not overly technical; rather, we endeavor to have the subjects presented in a somewhat similar fashion to PBS's NOVA. Our conferences have a history of bringing in a wide variety of distinguished speakers in their fields, in part represented by our featured speaker in 2011: Mr. Douglas Gardner, Deputy Director of the United Nations Bureau of Development. In previous years, our keynote speakers were Howard Bloom, author of several award winning books such as The Lucifer Principle and Global Brain, the honorable Dr. Peter Lyons, Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner, Dr. Arden Bement, Director of the National Science Foundation, and Bill Nye &ldquo;The Science Guy,&rdquo; host of the critically acclaimed children&rsquo;s television program. Bill Nye&rsquo;s keynote address boasted over 1000 attendees from throughout the Midwest. Our parent organization, the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs was founded in 1957 on the principles outlined in the 1955 Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which called for scientists to &ldquo;remember their humanity&rdquo; as they pushed forward with new scientific discoveries and technological developments. Purdue Student Pugwash, a branch of Student Pugwash USA (student affiliate of Pugwash), is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, interdisciplinary organization dedicated to the socially responsible application of science and technology. We work to make this philosophy a guiding focus in the lives of aspiring engineers and scientists. Our chapter was founded in 1991 and we have hosted a conference each year since 2005.","location":"Stewart Center, Purdue University","visibility":1,"date_time":"04-04-2014 17:30:00","url":"https%3A%2F%2Fboilerlink.purdue.edu%2Forganization%2Fpurduestudentpugwash%2Fcalendar%2Fdetails%2F331369"}

{"title":"Eat Right, Every Bite Health Fair","categories":"[Education]","desc":"   Student pharmacists from Purdue University, College of Pharmacy are partnering with Payless Pharmacy on Greenbush Street, Lafayette to host the first annual "Eat Right, Every Bite" Health Fair. According to CDC, over 37% of American adults are obese, and the annual medical cost associated with obesity is estimated to be $147 billion. Obesity is associated with many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart conditions, and dyslipidemia. From pharmacy didactic curriculum students learn that it is very challenging to treat a chronic disease once it progresses. However, many chronic diseases can be prevented by healthy eating and exercise. In addition, lifestyle modification such as healthy eating and exercise is key to every successful drug treatment.    &ldquo;Eat Right, Every Bite&rdquo; Health Fair will take place from 11:00 a.m until 3 p.m on April 5th in front of Payless Pharmacy. The topics covered include portion sizes, putting variety in vegetables and fruits, how to read a nutrition label, a visual aid of sugar packets in a bottle of coke, education on MyPlate, and spin-a-wheel quiz. This event will give students the opportunity to educate the community about the importance of healthy eating. It gives the students a chance to practice lifestyle modification counseling such as salt intake for hypertensive patients, or carbohydrate counting for diabetic patients. Because the education setting is located in a groceries market, it will make an impact on the shoppers to purchase healthier options and each educational topic will be more interactive.","location":"Payless Pharmacy","visibility":1,"date_time":"04-05-2014 00:00:00","url":"https%3A%2F%2Fboilerlink.purdue.edu%2Forganization%2Fpsshp%2Fcalendar%2Fdetails%2F397608"}
